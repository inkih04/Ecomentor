# üå± EcoMentor

**Promoting energy efficiency in Catalonia through mobile technology**

EcoMentor is a comprehensive mobile application ecosystem designed to improve building energy efficiency across Catalonia and foster sustainable lifestyles. Developed as part of the **PES (Proyectos de Ingenier√≠a del Software)** course at FIB-UPC, this project addresses the critical need for energy efficiency awareness, considering that over 80% of existing buildings in Catalonia have energy ratings below level E.

The application enables users to:

- **Interactive Building Maps**: Visualize real-time energy information of buildings across Catalonia based on official energy certificates with clustering for optimal visualization
- **Certificate Comparison**: Compare energy efficiency between different certified buildings with detailed metrics
- **Digital Pseudo-Certificates**: Generate indicative certificates through comprehensive questionnaires for uncertified buildings, calculated using official government algorithms
- **AI-Powered Sustainability Advisor**: Intelligent chatbot powered by Google Gemini providing personalized energy efficiency recommendations
- **Improvement Calculator**: Quantitative analysis of potential benefits and costs from building modifications using real energy consumption data
- **Achievement System**: Gamification features to encourage sustainable practices
- **Multi-platform Support**: Native iOS and Android apps with multi-language support (Catalan, Spanish, English)
